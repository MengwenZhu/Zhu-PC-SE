Part A: MATLAB Secondary Analysis Test Codes & Dataset

1. To begin with second-stage place cell & spatial engram analysis, you will need MATLAB (we used MATLAB 2021a) 
installed on your local machine, with the following toolboxes installed:
% Image processing
% Optimization
% Signal Processing
% Statistics and Machine Learning
% Curve Fitting
% Parallel Computing
% Mapping Toolbox

2. After starting MATLAB, go to 'Engram_Analysis'-'matlab'-'utilties', and click on 'startup.m'. There are instructions
in the code about setting up your computer. If successful the code will report machine name and the directory of codes.

3. Next, go to 'userParameters' folder that shows up on the left panel of MATLAB interface, and then click on 'getdsap.m'.
Go to section 2, and follow the instructions there to define directories & machine name.

4. After all is setup, find 'Master_Function.m' and open the code file. Click on Secondary Analysis section (should be 
highlighted after you click), and hit run section. If successful, the parallel pool on your machine should be activated,
shown on the lower left of MATLAB interface. 

5. When analysis is done, the output will be three MAT files within the 'Raw Data' folder: 'Data_Summary.mat' (contains
all essential parameters like mobility, RM, and PV except for place cell data), 'Placeness_MetaData.mat' (contains place
cell data), and 'XDay_Analysis.mat' (contains cross-day analysis data). 

6. Note: the codes is only capable of running primary analysis (CNMFe cell detection) if and only if Inscopix Data Processing
Software (IDPS v1.6) is installed on your local machine, and you have Ca-imaging recordings organized in a specific data structure.
The raw recordings are ~6GB each, which is too large to include here. Please reach out if you want to investigate them.

7. To visualize data, you need to modify functions within folder 'Graphing for Specific Dataset'. The codes are written for our complete
dataset, so you will have to modify the codes to visualize data.

8. We also provide the option to export data into excel tables for visualization in graphing softwares like Prism. Codes that can be 
modified for this selected dataset are found withiin folder 'For_Prism_Graphing'.

9. Please reach out if you need a completely analyzed summary in .MAT file (too big to include here, ~1.5GB)

Part B: R-scripts & summarized data used for performing linear mixed effects model (LMEM)

1. To perform statistical analyses, we transformed MAT file into excel files that summarize data in long-format. These files are located within
folder 'Data for Statistical Tests'. They have the exact same numbers as in the MAT file.

2. To begin, install R studio on your local machine. Then look for folder 'R-scripts' that contain the most essential LMEM we created for testing 
statistics within the manuscript. Other parameters could be reproduced with slight modifications of the codes.

3. Open 'initialize.R' and run the code. Install all packages when directed to do so.

4. Open 'Mobility_LMEM.R' and modify the directory to import the excel data. Then simply run the codes to visualize the results in a summarized table 
and plots. The data you should import with corresponding R scripts are:

Mobility_LMEM.R ==> 'Mobility.xlsx'
pMI_LMEM.R ==> 'MI_and_pMI.xlsx'
RM_LMEM ==> 'RM_correlation.xlsx'
PV_LMEM ==> 'PV_correlation.xlsx'

5. Note: there might be slight p-value discrepancies between what we reported in manuscript & the output of R-script (no change in significance level
or any statistical conclusions) because we recently re-run the dataset with more optimized parameters and it is done after the manuscript has been
submitted.
